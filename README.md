# radiosync
Proof of concept for syncing radio playback on FiveM

## Notes
- This is not a production ready resource. Its a proof of concept for server sided radio sync - do not use in your server unless you know what you're doing.
- Made possible by [Monkeypolice188's](https://github.com/Monkeypolice188) audio research, strings of song names come [from his research](https://github.com/Monkeypolice188/Monkys-Audio-Research/blob/main/.nametables/.txt/sounds.dat54.nametable.txt).
- Some DLC trackname strings seem to be missing, which causes the sync break for newer channels.
